Irish Suicides Analysis Read Me File

Before beginning the analysis, please use the datasets located in the folder DATA - CSO&PIETAHOUSE.
These are the main datasets and will be used throughout.
Both the original and modififed datasets are contained within these folders. 
Begin with the Pieta House 2013 cleaning script and continue with the analysis by year and 
then eventually to the CSO datasets. 

Project outline and stages followed in order:
Step 1 - clean
Step 2 - Tranformation/Merging
Step 3 - Algorithms 
 - Kmeans: note RStudio finds it difficult to run some of the code included. Kepp this
	in mind when using. 
	- Hierarchcial clusting is also included in this
 - SOM - these should give a basic view of clusters present/not present
 - PCA  - identifes any clusters in the data.


NOTE: Ensure that you have set your working directory and have the correct datasets to 
obtain the same results. 

* Results may differ in terms of algorithms, depending. The set.seed() fucntion should 
ensure the same results.
